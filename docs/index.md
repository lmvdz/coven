## What is Coven?

Coven is a **local-first runtime substrate**: a single Rust daemon that owns harness PTYs, session state, and an append-only event ledger on your own machine. CastCodes is the primary workspace and public proof surface for that runtime. The `coven` CLI/TUI remains the operator surface for installing, checking, and managing the daemon directly.

**Who is it for?** Developers and operators who want AI coding work to keep running locally, remember what it did, and stay inside project boundaries they can audit.

**What makes it different today?**

- **Local-first** — the daemon, the store, and the socket all live under `$COVEN_HOME`. No cloud relay, no daemon OAuth.
- **Harness-neutral** — Codex, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot CLI today, with a documented adapter bar for future harnesses. Same lifecycle, same rituals.
- **Project-rooted** — every launch carries an explicit project root and canonicalized working directory. The Rust daemon revalidates each request.
- **Inspectable** — sessions and events are SQLite rows you can browse with `coven sessions`, replay with `coven attach`, or sacrifice when you no longer need them.
- **MIT licensed** — packaged for early adopters under `@opencoven/*`, command always `coven`.

**What do you need?** A Rust stable toolchain (or the published `@opencoven/cli` wrapper), at least one supported harness CLI on `PATH`, and a project to run inside.

## How it works

The daemon is the single source of truth for sessions, PTY lifecycle, and capability routing.

## Quick start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Coven">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @opencoven/cli
    ```
    Building from source? See [Getting started](/GETTING-STARTED).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your environment">
    ```bash
    coven doctor
    ```
    `doctor` reports whether harness CLIs such as `codex`, `claude`, and `copilot` are on `PATH`, whether the daemon socket can bind, and what to install next.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the daemon">
    ```bash
    coven daemon start
    coven daemon status
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch your first session">
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    coven run codex "describe this repo"
    ```
    Or open the human session browser:

    ```bash
    coven sessions
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session browser

`coven sessions` opens a human-friendly browser of every live and archived session. Pick one, then choose a ritual:

- **Rejoin** — attach to a live PTY and follow its output.
- **View log** — open the append-only event log.
- **Summon** — restore an archived session into the active list.
- **Archive** — hide a finished session without deleting events.
- **Sacrifice** — permanently delete a non-running session (requires `--yes`).

Pipe-friendly variants exist too: `coven sessions --plain` for tables, `coven sessions --json` for clients.

## Configuration (optional)

Coven state lives under `$COVEN_HOME` (defaulting to `~/.coven` on macOS/Linux). The daemon binds a Unix socket at `<covenHome>/coven.sock` and refuses TCP by default.

- If you **do nothing**, Coven uses your existing local harness logins.
- If you want to lock it down, scope `$COVEN_HOME` per project root or per familiar.

Example:

```bash
export COVEN_HOME="$HOME/.local/share/coven"
coven daemon restart
```
