# Operate Coven sessions

Sessions are the durable record of a harness run. Use the interactive browser for discovery; use explicit commands when scripting or when you already have an id.

## List and identify a session

```sh
coven sessions --plain
coven sessions --all --plain
coven sessions --json
```

The default list omits archived sessions. `--all` includes them. Session-id arguments accept a unique prefix, but prefer the full id in scripts.

Search recorded events or inspect one record:

```sh
coven sessions search "authentication"
coven sessions show session-1
coven sessions events session-1
coven sessions log session-1
```

## Replay or rejoin live work

```sh
coven attach session-1
```

`attach` replays recorded output and follows a live Coven-managed session. It is not a new harness launch. Use the session browser (`coven sessions`) when you want to choose Rejoin or View Log without copying an id.

## Archive and restore finished work

Archive hides a completed session from the default list without deleting its events:

```sh
coven archive session-1
coven sessions --all --plain
```

Restore it with `summon`:

```sh
coven summon session-1
```

`summon` clears the archive state and can replay or follow the selected session. Archive is the reversible cleanup action.

## Stop or delete deliberately

For a running session, preserve the event log while ending the managed process:

```sh
coven kill session-1
```

For a non-running session you no longer need, permanently delete the record and event history only with explicit confirmation:

```sh
coven sacrifice session-1 --yes
```

There is no undo for sacrifice. Archive first when you only want to remove work from the active list.
